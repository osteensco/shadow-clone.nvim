- basic idea is to provide a robust API for creating, managing, and manipulating floating windows

    - main features:
        [X] split floating windows 
        [-] multiple splits with single command
            - ability to add number to command 
                - ex. 4 <multisplitcmd> should split window evenly in quarters
        [X] navigate between floating windows at same level
            - similar to normal window navigation using h,j,k,l
        [X] cycle and swap window groups along z axis
        [-] move individual windows along the 'z' axis
            - really should just extend bubble functions to do this
        [X] implement additional stack for hidden windows
            - between a hidden toggle 
            - ability to move a hidden group to the top of the main stack
                - see ''telescope view' below
        [X] option for permanent toggle
            - toggle group API
                - this would allow for multiple specific keymaps (help docs, terminal, project configuration files, etc)
            - toggle would have to be explicitly
                - swapped to a new group
                - allocated to a specific group (attempted to toggle a non allocated group would fail)
                - deallocated (specifically unassign a group from the toggle slot with a command)
        [X] move current buffer into a floating window and back into a non floating split window
            - bubbleup / bubbledown
        [X] create/manage float groups
            - a float group should represent all floats contained on a given z access
        [-] telescope view of groups (hidden and visible) for easy navigation
            - config option to hide current visible windows
        [-] "hide all" command
            - essentially just move entire main stack to hidden stack
        [-] opening a new floating window with one visible should place new float at top of z stack
        [-] should natively support/integrate other plugins that manage floating windows and buffer navigation
            - ex. toggleterm, arrow, harpoon, etc.
            - requires listeners to place floating windows in groups
                - this comes with caveats like 
                    - ignoring shadow-clone created windows (avoid duplication)
                    - ignoring or handling 'volatile' windows (windows that close their buffer when exited)
                        - this should just be the difference between nvim_win_close and nvim_win_hide

    - potential advanced features:
        [-] automagic resizing 
            - a use case would be if a window is moved to a group (z index) already containing multiple windows
                - this would also require auto positioning
            - fill in space with adjacent window if a window closes
            - toggleable/adjustable in config
        [-] support continuous manual resizing and movement of floating windows
            - hold down key bindings to:
                - expand/reduce height/width
                - move float horizontally/laterally along current z access
                - ability do each of these with multiple windows at once
        [-] make pretty command that fixes overlapping floats on current z axis
            - adjust current group's layout by automatically moving and resizing floats
        [-] persist window configurations by project using CWD
