- basic idea is to provide a robust API for creating, managing,  and manipulating floating windows

    - main features:
        -Xsplit floating windows 
        - multiple splits with single command
        - navigate between floating windows at same level
            - similar to normal window navigation using h,j,k,l
        - navigate between and move windows along the 'z' axis
            - hides window at specific z index
        - automagic resizing at same z index if a window closes
            - toggleable in config
        - support continuous manual resizing of floating windows
            - hold down a key binding to expand/reduce height/width
        - move current buffer into a floating window and back into a non floating split window
            - bubbleup / bubbledown
        - create/manage float groups
            - a float group should represent all floats contained on a given z access
        - telescope view of open buffers and float groups
        - opening a new floating window with one visible should place new float at top of z stack
        - should natively support/integrate other plugins that manage floating windows and buffer navigation
            - ex. toggleterm, arrow, harpoon, etc.

    - potential advanced features:
        - persist window configurations by project using CWD
        - a window selection UI like OS window selection view

- code improvements
    - ADD TESTS
    - last accessed should just be a stack
    - window type should be part of window obj, or accessible via a method
    - add lua "types"
        - @class
        - @fields
    - add arg and return types
        - @param
        - @return
