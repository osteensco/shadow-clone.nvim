- basic idea is to provide a robust API for creating, managing,  and manipulating floating windows

    - main features:
        [X] split floating windows 
        [-] multiple splits with single command
            - ability to add number to command 
                - ex. 4 <multisplitcmd> should split window evenly in quarters
        [X] navigate between floating windows at same level
            - similar to normal window navigation using h,j,k,l
        [X] cycle and swap window groups along z axis
        [-] move individual windows along the 'z' axis
        [-] implement additional stack for hidden windows
            - between a hidden toggle 
            - ability to move a hidden group to the top of the main stack
                - see ''telescope view' below
        [X] move current buffer into a floating window and back into a non floating split window
            - bubbleup / bubbledown
        [X]create/manage float groups
            - a float group should represent all floats contained on a given z access
        [-]telescope view of groups (hidden and visible) for easy navigation
            - config option to hide current visible floats
        [-]opening a new floating window with one visible should place new float at top of z stack
        [-]should natively support/integrate other plugins that manage floating windows and buffer navigation
            - ex. toggleterm, arrow, harpoon, etc.

    - potential advanced features:
        [-]automagic resizing 
            - if a window is moved to a z index with multiple windows
                - this would also require auto positioning
            - at same z index if a window closes
            - toggleable in config
        [-]support continuous manual resizing and movement of floating windows
            - hold down key bindings to:
                - expand/reduce height/width
                - move float horizontally/laterally along current z access
        [-]make pretty command that fixes overlapping floats on current z axis
            - adjust current group's layout by automatically moving and resizing floats
        [-]persist window configurations by project using CWD
        [-]a window selection UI like OS window selection view

- code improvements
    [-]ADD TESTS
    [-]last accessed should just be a stack
    [-]window type should be part of window obj, or accessible via a method
    [-]add lua "types"
        - @class
        - @fields
    [-]add arg and return types
        - @param
        - @return
