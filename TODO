- basic idea is to provide a robust API for floating windows
    - mostly designed for terminals but useable with any kind of buffer
    - split floating windows
    - navigate between floating windows
    - navigate the 'z' access of windows (floating to non floating and back)
    - create/manage window groups
    - telescope view of open windows
    - persist window configurations by project using CWD
    - fully integrate with toggleterm
    - move current buffer into a floating window and back into a split window
    - a window selection UI like OS window selection view
- code improvements
    - last accessed should just be a stack
    - window type should be part of window obj
    - add lua "types"
        - @class
        - @fields
    - add arg and return types
        - @param
        - @return
