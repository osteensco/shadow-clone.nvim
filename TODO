- basic idea is to provide a robust API for creating, managing,  and manipulating floating windows
    - main features:
        - split floating windows
        - navigate between floating windows at same level
        - navigate between and move windows along the 'z' axis
            - hides window at specific z value
        - move current buffer into a floating window and back into a non floating split window
        - create/manage window groups
        - telescope view of open windows and groups
        - should be natively integrated with other plugins that manage floating windows and buffer navigation
            - ex. toggleterm, arrow, harpoon, etc.
    - potential advanced features:
        - persist window configurations by project using CWD
        - a window selection UI like OS window selection view
- code improvements
    - ADD TESTS
    - last accessed should just be a stack
    - window type should be part of window obj, or accessible via a method
    - add lua "types"
        - @class
        - @fields
    - add arg and return types
        - @param
        - @return
