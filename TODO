TODO

- basic idea is to provide a robust API floating windows
    - mostly designed for terminals but useable with any kind of buffer
    - split floating windows
    - navigate between floating windows
    - navigate the 'z' access of windows (floating to non floating and back)
    - create/manage window groups
    - telescope view of open windows
    - persist window configurations by project using CWD
    - fully integrate with toggleterm
    - move current buffer into a floating window and back into a split window
    - a window selection UI like OS window selection view
